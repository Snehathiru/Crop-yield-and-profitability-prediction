The scope of this project is to investigate a dataset of crop records for the agricultural sector using machine learning techniques. Identifying crop predictions by farmers is more difficult. We try to reduce this risk factor behind selection of the crop.

Datasets
datafile.csv One finds out the profit and classifies it if there is profit or loss.
crop_production.csv The second dataset predicts the production.
